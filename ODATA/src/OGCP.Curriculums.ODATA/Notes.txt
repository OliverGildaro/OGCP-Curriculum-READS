Provide an uniform way to describe data and data model
Improve semantic interoperability between systems
Provides metadata that is a readable description of the data model
The code that needs a client to talk with odata API can be generated because it is an standar
***EDM***

**** ODATA QUERIES ****
Parse: Inspect the url are parse query strings
Validate: Check wHat we asked is allowed
Apply the query: COnvert the query options into LINQ expressions
Deferered execution is the key
The expressions is aplied to what is returned from the http action method
That allows to odata query options extend the IQueryable query variable toutght the EnableQuery filter
Does not support async calls for build sql expressions approach
May support async calls but the expression query is applied in memory collections
